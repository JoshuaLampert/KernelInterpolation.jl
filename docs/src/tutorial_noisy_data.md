# Dealing with noisy data

This tutorial is based on Chapter 19 of [^Fasshauer2007] and will show how we can use regularization techniques and least-squares
fitting to deal with noisy data.

## Define problem setup and perform interpolation

## Use regularization to stabilize the approximation

## Use least-squares approximation to fit noisy data
